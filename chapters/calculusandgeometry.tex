\section{Invitation: graph of functions}

If I told you to \emph{sketch} out $x^2$, it'd be easy right? Just a simple parabola would do. But if I say: plot $x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 - x + 1$? Isn't so easy now is it. One way would be to substitute in various value and plot it into the graph directly. But I'm asking for a rough sketch, not a plot. I just want the general shape and structure of the function: where are the highest and lowest points, the $x$-intercept, and the $y$-intercept. We're going to learn how to do exactly that in this chapter.
