# Compact Calculus

This is a repository for a Calculus textbook, still very work in progress

## Goals and Vision

The goal of this textbook is to be the textbook that's easy to read and concise, as the title says, "compact calculus".
The main focus of this textbook is to *deliver* the *intuition* behind calculus. Rigorosity naturally comes later after the main ideas are fully developed.
The approach that I'd be taking is already in the file `main.pdf`, on Reading Guide and Preface (Still W.I.P.)

## Compiling the Textbook

Use XeLaTeX + BiBTeX on the file `main.tex`
